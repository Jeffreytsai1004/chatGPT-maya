# chatGPT-maya

Just a tool that simply executes the code to maya after being generated by openai chatGPT.

Unfortunatly, complicated requests don't work,
but simple automation tasks works, specially if you communicate in a logical way and break down steps.

To test out and play with it:

1. 
You need to navigate to your Program Files\Autodesk\Maya20**\bin,

2. 
Inside this directory you need to open up a cmd terminal and run "mayapy -m pip install openai" to install openai python package into Maya (its important your cmd terminals path points to the Program Files\Autodesk\Maya20**\bin path. )

3. 
you need to get an API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

4. 
go to my github account and copy the code into your Maya script editor,
https://github.com/LouisRossouw/chatGPT-maya/blob/master/ChatGPT_Maya.py

5. 
either add your API key into an environment variable called "OPENAI_API_KEY", OR on line 44 where it says  API = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") , replace it with your new API key from openai (Not recommended, your API keys should be kept private.).
