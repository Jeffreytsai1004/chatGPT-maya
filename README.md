# chatGPT-maya

Just a tool that simply executes the code to maya after being generated by openai chatGPT.

Unfortunatly, complicated requests don't work,
but simple automation tasks works, specially if you communicate in a logical way and break down steps.

To test out and play with it:

- Maya needs openai installed: - in autodesk/maya/bin directory: run "mayapy -m pip install openai" with terminal.
- an openai API key is needed, so either directly add your key into the API variable below (Not recommended,
  your API keys should be kept private.) or put it in maya env under a variable called "OPENAI_API_KEY".
